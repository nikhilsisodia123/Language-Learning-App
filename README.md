# Language-Learning-App
This is a Tkinter app for langauge learning, with the ability to add and delete languages and modify data in the datatbase (uses sqlite3). The reason I made this project is to mix three of my personal aims, to increase my Python skills, to improve my SQL skills and to learn French. By mixing all three, I also learn the skill of implementing multiple ideas to work towards a main goal. Currently, running the script with the database file provided will bring you to the quiz page where you can translate french things. The mode will be text only, while the picture only mode makes you translate a picture rather than a sentence. The reason this mode exists is because when naming things I tend to think of its name in English and then translate that into French. This mode aims to get rid of the intemediary position that English plays in my mind during translation so that I think of the French word(s) straight after looking at something. Therefore, I will learn French as more of a first language than a second language. This was a big inspiration for this project.
Currently, the Home and Settings button do not work but this will be sorted soon. The accent buttons are also not in the Add Data window so this will be done. The aim is to have multiple keyboards for different languages and the option for the user to create a custom keyboard.
